I’m Vivek Sabarad. I like problems where theory meets experiment and simple ideas unlock surprising behavior. During my BS–MS at IISER Pune, I spent most of my time thinking about how to make quantum systems useful with the tools we have today. That meant building and testing ideas in NMR, and learning when a clean equation becomes messy—and interesting—in the lab.

In September 2025, I’ll join Prof. Walther’s group at the University of Vienna for my PhD. I’m excited about three threads that keep weaving through my work:

- Quantum machine learning, especially kernels and how they capture structure in data.
- Quantum information with NMR—using well‑understood hardware to prototype quantum ideas.
- Open quantum systems—understanding dynamics beyond ideal, Markovian limits.

These threads show up across my projects: from implementing quantum kernels in liquid‑state NMR and exploring quantum reservoir computing on solid‑state spins, to studying non‑Markovian dynamics and connections between causality and thermodynamic stability. If you’re curious, the project pages have short, readable summaries.

What I value most is clarity: does a method actually buy you something, can you measure it, and will it scale? That question has guided my thesis work and the projects I’m keen to pursue next.

## Beyond the lab
I like sharing physics—on campus I volunteered with Disha (outreach and education) and helped organize Mimamsa, a student‑run science challenge. When I’m not at a whiteboard, I’m usually reading, sketching ideas, or chasing a better explanation for something that “everybody knows.”

## What’s next
At Vienna, I want to push on practical quantum learning—tests that are honest about noise and resources, and theory that tells us when quantum structure is worth the effort. If that resonates, I’d love to chat.
