- Venue: IISER Pune (with Prof. T S Mahesh; collaboration with Prof. M S Santhanam)
- Period: August 2024 â€“ December 2024

Highlights:
- Studied Quantum Kicked Top (QKT) as a reservoir for ML tasks (e.g., time-series prediction).
- Implemented QKT-like reservoir using a solid-state NMR system; optimized encoding schemes.
- Developed methods for encoding quantum inputs for tasks like entanglement classification.
