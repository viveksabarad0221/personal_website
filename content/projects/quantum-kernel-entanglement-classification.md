- Venue: IISER Pune (MS thesis under Prof. T S Mahesh)
- Period: August 2024 â€“ Present
- Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09557

Highlights:
- Devised a quantum kernel for quantum input data.
- Numerically simulated the kernel to classify entangling vs. non-entangling unitaries.
- Experimental implementation using a two-layered star system in liquid-state NMR.
